👋 Hi, I’m @Neha-Gi

👀 I’m passionate about Python programming.



🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Python, mastering testing (TDD), debugging, 
and various frameworks. I'm also learning about databases with SQL, Django ORM, 
and addressing the n+1 query problem. Additionally, I'm exploring web application 
development using Django, logging, and the Django REST Framework. My studies also 
cover consuming and producing APIs, emphasizing service-to-service communication. 
Furthermore, I'm gaining insights into cloud computing fundamentals with AWS and GCP.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-based projects focusing on data analysis.
 
📫 How to reach me: Message me here on GitHub or connect on LinkedIn.
